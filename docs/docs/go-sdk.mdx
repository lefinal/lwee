# Go SDK

The LWEE Go SDK provides an easy way of building actions with the [Go](https://go.dev/) programming language.
The concurrency concepts and fast learning curve make it appealing to building applications with it.
LWEE provides you with an SDK to make it even easier.
Under the hood, it uses [LWEE streams](./streams.mdx).

## Getting started

Create a new project action with:

```shell
lwee create-action
```

Enter your action name.
This will also be the name of the module.
Then, select **Go (SDK)** as template.
Your action is now created and initialized with a template.

If you want to add the Go SDK to an existing project, you can run:

```shell
go get -u github.com/lefinal/lwee/go-sdk
```

## Concepts

The SDK uses [LWEE streams](./streams.mdx) for data transmission.
For a simple application you need to perform these steps:

1. Create a client.
2. Register your input stream requests.
3. Register your output stream offers.
4. Add your data handling.
5. Serve the client.

How to do that will be explained in the following sections.
We will explain the template step by step.
Note that we do not add specific error handling.
Proper error handling is your own responsibility.

## Creating the client

First, we need to import the SDK into our application/file:

```go
import "github.com/lefinal/lwee/go-sdk/lweeclient"
```

Then, we need to create an LWEE client.

```go
client := lweeclient.New(lweeclient.Options{})
```

Normally, you do not need to supply any options.

## Registering input stream requests

Each input stream has a name.
We create a request for it in the following way:

```go
entriesInput, err := client.RequestInputStream("entries")
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
```

This adds a request for the input stream with name _entries_.
The returned value is of type `lweeclient.InputReader`.
It implements the `io.Reader` interface along with `WaitForInput(context.Context) error`.
We will use this reader later.

Add all remaining input stream requests.

## Registering output stream offers

Each output stream has a name as well.
We create offers like this:

```go
entryCountOutput, err := client.ProvideOutputStream("entryCount")
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
defer entryCountOutput.Close(nil)
```

This adds an offer for the output stream with name _entryCount_.
The returned value is an `lweeclient.OutputWriter` which implements `io.WriteCloser` along with `Open() error` and `Close(error)`.

::::tip
In Go, it is considered best-practice to `defer` closing of resources to minimize chances of forgetting to close them which could lead to resource leaks.
The `defer` statement will close the body when the function exits.
::::

Add your remaining output stream offers as well.

## Adding application logic

When dealing with data, we will work on the created input readers and output writers.
In most cases, we wait for input streams to open.
We will then read data from them and process it.
Once output data is available, we will open the corresponding output stream(s) once and then write our data.

In the following example, we expect the input stream to receive entries, separated by line separators.
We want to count the number of entries (lines).
Let's get started and add our logic.

To do so, we register a do-function on the client.
This is just a helper method so that we can skip synchronizing multiple goroutines and managing `context.Context` by letting the SDK handle it for us.
The method signature is as follows:

```go
Do(func(ctx context.Context) error)
```

This will start the function in a new goroutine and pass the client's lifetime context.
If the function returns an error, execution will be considered failed and the client shuts down.
The client will block in `Serve` (see below) until all functions, registered via `Do` have finished.

Let us get back to our example:
First, we need to wait until our input stream with the entries is open.

```go
err := entriesInput.WaitForOpen(ctx)
if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("wait for entries input to open: %w", err)
}
```

Then, we need to create a scanner so that we can read each line separately.
We do not want to read all input data at once as we expect large data amounts.
Therefore, we use I/O directly.

```go
scanner := bufio.NewScanner(entriesInput)
entryCount := 0
for scanner.Scan() {
    entryCount++
}
err = scanner.Err()
if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("read entries input: %w", err)
}
```

Now that we have our entry count, we can output it.
To do that, we first notify LWEE that the output is ready:

```go
err = entryCountOutput.Open()
if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("open entry count output: %w", err)
}
```

Then we write the result to the output:

```go
_, err = io.Copy(entryCountOutput, strings.NewReader(strconv.Itoa(entryCount)))
if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("output entry count: %w", err)
}
entryCountOutput.Close(nil)
```

At the end, we simply return `nil`.

::::note
In case of an error and not using `Do`, you could also close the output with a non-nil error.
This will also notify LWEE that execution failed and the client will shut down as well.
::::

## Starting the client

Finally, outside the `Do` function, we can now start the client with `Serve()`.
This will serve the HTTP API used by LWEE to connect.
The call will block until the client is instructed by LWEE to shut down and all `Do`-functions have finished.

```go
err = client.Serve()
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
```
