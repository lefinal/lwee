# Usage

Make sure to have LWEE properly set up by running:

```shell
lwee version
```

The command syntax is:
```
lwee [options] command
```

When running commands, LWEE searches in the current or parent directory for an LWEE project.
These are identified by having a _.lwee_ directory in the project root.
Alternatively, you can specify the project path manually using [--dir](#--dir).

## Commands

LWEE provides multiple commands for workflow programming and execution.
If you run the application in an LWEE project, you will be prompted with a command selection.
Select a command from the list and then press <kbd>ENTER</kbd> to execute.

Alternatively, you can specify the command directly when invoking LWEE.

### run, r

Run the specified workflow in the current project.

### verify, v

Perform a dry run of the workflow but do not execute actions.

### create-action, ca

Create a project action in the current project.
You will be prompted with the name of the action to create.
It is recommended to name your action in kebab-case.
You will then be asked to select an action template.
The following options are available:

- **None**: This will initialize the action with no files.
It is your responsibility to set up a proper [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/).
- **Go (SDK)**: Creates a Go application with an LWEE Go SDK template and ready-to-use [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/).
Creating the action might take a while as LWEE will set up the latest version of the SDK.
- **Go (native)**: Creates a Go application without any dependencies as well as a ready-to-use [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/).

You can find the created project action in the _/actions_ directory.

### init

Initializes a new LWEE project in the current working directory.
This includes setting up directories as well as creating a flow file template.

### version

Prints the installed version of LWEE.

### help

Prints a help summary.

## Flags

[//]: # (TODO)

### --verbose, -v

Enabled output of debug logs.

### --dir

Specifies the location of the project directory.
If not set, the current working directory and its parents will be searched for an LWEE project and used instead.

### --flow, -f

Specifies the flow file to use.
If a non-absolute file path is provided, the LWEE project's path will be used as the base.
Defaults to _flow.yaml_.

### --no-cleanup

If set, temporary files and containers will not be cleaned up.
This is useful for debugging purposes.
Make sure to clean up possibly dangling containers yourself.

This flag can also be set using environment variables.
Set `LWEE_NO_CLEANUP` to `true` to disable cleanup.

### --engine

Specifies the container engine to use.
Possible values are:

- _docker_

If not set, _docker_ will be used.

This flag can also be set using environment variables.
Set `LWEE_ENGINE` to the desired value.

### --help, -h

Prints a help summary.
