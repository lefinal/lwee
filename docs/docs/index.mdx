# Getting Started

Get to know how to install and setup LWEE.

## What you'll need

Make sure to have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed.

## Installation

Get started by downloading the latest version of LWEE from the [releases page](https://github.com/lefinal/lwee/releases).

On Linux:

```shell
sudo mv /path/to/downloaded/binary /usr/local/bin
```

On any other operating system, move the binary to a location that is in your PATH.

## Project initialization

Create a new LWEE project in the current folder with:

```shell
lwee init
```

## Project structure

An LWEE project consists of these files:

- _.lwee_: LWEE internal folder. Also marks an LWEE project.
- _actions_: Directory for project actions.
- _out_: Output directory.
- _src_: Source data.
- _flow.yaml_: Default flow.
