# Stdout

`stdout`

Reads data from stdout until the operation exits.
This output type is the easiest to use and has a wide range of support for other programming languages and applications.

::::tip
Although LWEE provides buffering for IO, you should try to avoid many small writes to stdout.
LWEE can only reduce the latency it takes for the receiver to read the data but not the general IO latency due to writes.
Use buffers where available.
