# Image Action

Image actions do not build an image from local sources but fetch it.
This is similar to how you usually use Docker.

::::tip
Always pin your image versions to avoid unwanted changes due to image updates.

## Configuration

```yaml
type: image
# The image to use. Required.
image: "python:3.9.18"
# Overwrite the configured command in the image.
command:
  - "my-command"
  - "with"
  - "arguments"
# Environment variables for the container in key-value pairs.
env:
  key1: "value1"
  key2: "value2"
```

## Templating

Additional available fields:

- `.Action.Extras.WorkspaceHostDir`: Temporary directory on the host that is mounted to the container.
- `.Action.Extras.WorkspaceMountDir`: Directory in the container where the workspace from the host is mounted.
Usually, this is at _/lwee_.
