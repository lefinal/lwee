# File

`file`

Extracts data from the flow to a file.

::::tip
Try to output your files to _out_ in the project directory.
This improves reproducibility as when you check-in the project into a VCS or upload it, all related data is available for reproducing results or altering data processing.
Run information will be written to _out/run-info.yaml_ by default, so all required information to understand the data processing is available in the project.

## Configuration

```yaml
provideAs: file
# Filename. If not absolute, relative to the project's root directory.
filename: src/my_data.csv
```
